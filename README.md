# Open Travel Platform

<p align="center"><strong>English</strong> · <a href="./README.es.md">Español</a></p>

> Reusable open-source travel platform foundation for agencies, tour operators and booking products.

Open Travel Platform is a clean-room **Next.js + TypeScript + MongoDB** platform built around explicit domain, repository and adapter boundaries. It supports infrastructure-free demo onboarding, persistent production capabilities and provider-neutral self-host deployment.

The official commercial/reference implementation is **Kairoseth Travel**, deployed at **[travel.kairoseth.com](https://travel.kairoseth.com)**.

## Project model

This repository is the **MIT-licensed provider-neutral core**. Kairoseth Travel is the hosted/commercial reference implementation.

- customer data and proprietary customer integrations stay outside the public repository;
- private Kairoseth/customer adapters may depend on public OTP contracts, never the reverse;
- downstream providers never receive implicit booking, inventory, pricing or payment authority.

## Current position

**Phase 8 — External integrations: COMPLETE.**  
**Phase 9 — Production hardening engineering baseline: COMPLETE.**  
**Phase 10 — Open-source productisation: IN PROGRESS.**

Completed Phase 10 slices:

- **10.1 Reproducible fresh-clone/demo bootstrap — COMPLETE**
- **10.2 Provider-neutral self-host standalone deployment — COMPLETE**
- **10.3 Extension contracts and reference adapters — COMPLETE**
- **10.4 Release and migration conventions — COMPLETE**

Phase 10.4 establishes:

- Semantic Versioning for public stable releases;
- immutable Git tags in `vX.Y.Z` form;
- release identity alignment across `package.json`, README badge and CHANGELOG;
- releases cut only from verified `main`;
- explicit migration classification and rollback/recovery requirements;
- **expand → migrate → contract** for compatible persistent-data evolution;
- no hidden destructive migrations during application startup;
- permanent validation through `npm run check:release-migrations`.

Authoritative Phase 10.4 documentation:

- [`docs/RELEASES.md`](docs/RELEASES.md)
- [`docs/RELEASES.es.md`](docs/RELEASES.es.md)
- [`docs/MIGRATIONS.md`](docs/MIGRATIONS.md)
- [`docs/MIGRATIONS.es.md`](docs/MIGRATIONS.es.md)

Credentialed Stripe/Redsys TEST/LIVE E2E remains a separate provider-dependent release validation until suitable provider accounts are available.

## Core capabilities

### Catalogue and commerce

- bilingual EN/ES catalogue and Operator experience;
- destinations, trips, itineraries, departures and live inventory;
- accommodation/rooms and seasonal/occupancy pricing;
- Activities, Transport and Travel protection products;
- transactional reservations with server-authoritative pricing/inventory;
- travellers/minors/guardians and historical pricing snapshots;
- package supplements and post-booking amendments.

### Identity and operations

- persistent customer/staff authentication;
- separate customer/staff sessions;
- RBAC and granular Operator/Admin capabilities;
- operational ownership, notes, priority, tags and timeline;
- tasks/follow-ups and supplier fulfilment;
- advanced queues/filtering;
- privileged audit where required.

### Payments and finance

- provider-neutral payment/refund ledger;
- bank transfer, cash and external-terminal movements;
- Stripe/Redsys checkout integrations;
- deposits/installments/outstanding balance;
- reconciliation/revenue reporting;
- downstream-only ERP/accounting synchronization.

### Traveller data and production hardening

- encrypted post-purchase Traveller Data and key rotation;
- privacy-right workflows and retention policy;
- WCAG 2.2 AA-oriented accessibility baseline;
- CSP/security headers, Origin validation and throttling;
- liveness/readiness and `demo|live` deployment profiles;
- MongoDB concurrency/idempotency, backup/restore and index validation;
- repeatable performance/resource baselines.

### Integrations and extension model

- transactional MongoDB integration outbox;
- signed HTTPS webhooks with retry/dead-letter handling;
- REST `BookingRepository`, supplier fulfilment, downstream CRM/ERP and failure transport;
- nine verified first-class public extension interfaces;
- provider-specific payload containment and explicit authority boundaries;
- permanent extension gate through `check:extension-contracts`.

## Quick start

Requires **Node.js 24 LTS** and the npm version declared in `packageManager`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Emmakex/open-travel-platform.git
cd open-travel-platform
npm ci
npm run setup:demo
npm run dev
```

The demo profile requires no MongoDB, SMTP, PSP, CRM, ERP or supplier credentials.

## Self-host standalone

```bash
npm ci
npm run setup:demo
npm run build
npm run package:standalone
node .next/standalone/server.js
```

For production deployment see [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) and [`docs/PRODUCTION-CHECKLIST.md`](docs/PRODUCTION-CHECKLIST.md).

## Release and migration contract

Stable releases use:

```text
package.json  -> X.Y.Z
Git tag       -> vX.Y.Z
CHANGELOG     -> ## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
```

Before a release:

```bash
npm ci
npm run check:release
npm run check:release-migrations
npm run verify
```

Persistent-data/configuration/wire changes must be classified and documented with verification and rollback/recovery guidance. Application startup must not perform hidden destructive migrations.

See [`docs/RELEASES.md`](docs/RELEASES.md) and [`docs/MIGRATIONS.md`](docs/MIGRATIONS.md).

## Permanent validation

Important project-level gates include:

```bash
npm run check:extension-contracts
npm run check:release-migrations
npm run verify
```

Dedicated workflows protect extension contracts and release/migration conventions in pull requests and on `main`.

## Phase completion rule

A phase/slice is not complete until implementation and tests are finished, EN/ES documentation/README/ROADMAP/CHANGELOG are synchronized, the PR scope is reviewed, required CI is green, the PR is merged to `main`, and `main` is verified before the next phase starts.

Phase 10.4 follows this rule; later Phase 10 work remains separate until explicitly started.
